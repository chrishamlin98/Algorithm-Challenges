# Algorithm-Challenges

/* The first challenge was a double sum type of problem.  

My brute force method is to create a basic Algorithm that uses multiple
pre-defined variables and an if-else chain.

My next method is to create an array do a basic array traversal that will
do the same thing as my brute force method, without specified inputs.

My last method is to work through a graph based solution using data structures.
