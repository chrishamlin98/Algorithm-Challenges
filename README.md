<p>Challenge 1: <a href="https://github.com/chrishamlin98/Algorithm-Challenges/tree/master/Double%20Sum">Double Sum</a></p>
<p>Challenge 2: <a href="https://github.com/chrishamlin98/Algorithm-Challenges/tree/master/Reverse%20Integers">Reverse Integers</a></p>

[TL;DR]
<a href="https://github.com/chrishamlin98/Algorithm-Challenges/tree/master/Double%20Sum">Double Sum</a> - My brute force method is to create a basic Algorithm that uses multiple pre-defined variables and an if-else chain.

My next method is to create an array do a basic array traversal that will
do the same thing as my brute force method, without specified inputs.

My last method is to work through a graph based solution using data structures.
*/

// Update - The brute force method turned into multiple ways to syntactically
accomplish the same thing.  As suggested by multiple people, using a hash table
is more efficient. //
